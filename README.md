# Replication of a Study of Efficient Training of Retrieval Models Using Negative Cache

In This repo i do a replication's Study of the Paper [Efficient Training of Retrieval Models Using Negative Cache](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=824xC-SgWgU)

For my Study i use the pytorch Implementation in the Negative Sample available [hier](https://github.com/marceljahnke/negative-cache)

I also decided to use the same learning rate as the one used in the paper.

The Dataset used for the study is the msmarco passage.
